        <h3> The sun shines brightly, </h3>
        <h3> and so are you </h3>
        <h3> Every living in this world is a work of art, </h3>
        <h3> and so are you </h3>
        <h3> Just like Nature you are admirable</h3>
        <h3> As I gazed into your eyes, I’m hoping you will always be here</h3>
        <h3> for my heart holds on for you, </h3>
        <h3> I’ll always look out for you</h3>
